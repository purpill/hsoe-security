Meeting Notes for Monday Pi Setup
=================================

	1)	Connected Pi to computer. We used the computer as a router to connect to the Raspberry Pi over Wifi to obtain the Raspberry Piâ€™s IP address using the command ifconfig
	2)	Set up Github and created a repository. My username is purpill and the repository name is hsoe-security. If you are running a Mac you can download the Github app otherwise you can access github through the terminal if you are using a unix based operating system. Im not sure about Windows since no one had one.
